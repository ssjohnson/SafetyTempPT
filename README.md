#SafetyTempPT

###Safety Temp Prototype Version 2

This is the program I wrote to monitor a temperature sensor and transmit the readings via wi-fi to xively.com, using the Arduino Mega microcontroller board and several different outside components. This was designed to control a pool, spa, or sauna heater, to keep temperature below 105Â° (or any given threshold), per NYS law.

In version 2, we added the wi-fi chip and sourced the libraries we used to drive it. The program successfully submits readings to xively. 

All libraries used in this program are open source under the GNU public liscense.
